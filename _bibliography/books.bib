    abstract = {This chapter presents a comprehensive review of continuous chromatography for protein polishing using ion-exchange. The limitations of batch chromatography are discussed. Different types of continuous chromatography, such as rotating chromatography, simulated moving bed, and multicolumn continuous chromatography, are introduced in detail. The advantages of continuous chromatography over batch chromatography are highlighted, including higher yield, purity, productivity, and lower buffer consumption. Both experiment-based and model-based methods for process design are discussed. The applications of continuous ion-exchange chromatography in laboratory-level and industrial-level cases about monoclonal antibodies and PEGylated proteins are also presented. It can be concluded that continuous chromatography has the potential to revolutionize the industry.},
